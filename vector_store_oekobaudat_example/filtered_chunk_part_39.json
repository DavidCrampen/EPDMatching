The electrical energy is derived from renewable energy source (hydropower) that have obtained certification with the guarantee of origin. The electrical energy is converted from high voltage to low voltage using an electrical transformer located close to the plants. The certification of the renewability of the energy covers to whole period analysed in this study (2021-2022). For as concerns the energy source to feed the furnace for the NHL production, hard coal, with a total heat evolution of 787 Mcal to cook 1 ton of NHL, was considered. For the internal transportations, gasoline with a calorific power of 45 MJ/kg was considered. For as concerns the end-of-life stage, the demolition, transport, treatment, and disposal of wastes were modelled using processes present in the Ecoinvent database and modified to the specific case. In particular, for the C1 stage (demolition/deconstruction) the use of a diesel operating machine with a productivity of 16.6 min/ton of demolished material and a diesel consumption of 0.9 lt/m3 was considered. A water consumption of 0.018 m3 /m3 was considered. Both references were taken from Ivanica et al., for the C2 stage a distance of 15 km was assumed according to data provided by Italia del Riciclo referred to the year 2021., for the C3 and C4 stages, despite the NHL binder can be fully recycled and due to the lack of specific information regarding the end-of-life of this product, it was assumed that, after a sorting and crushing process, 78.1 wt% of inert wastes is recycled (reaching the end-of-waste state) while the remaining part is landfilled (data provided by Italia del Riciclo referred to the year 2021). For the sorting and crushing process an existing Ecoinvent process was adapted to the specific case., for the stage D it was considered that the secondary materials were used as alternative to gravel for the production of concrete and for road construction (the background process used refers to the period 2013-2021). Benefits and impacts associated to these operations were therefore evaluated. According to EN 16908:2017+A1 the carbonation of natural hydraulic lime, cement and hydrated lime can be very relevant after demolition with consistent carbon dioxide uptake. The evaluation of carbon dioxide uptake was carried out according to the procedure described in EN 16757. In particular it was considered that: for the C1-C3 stages no carbonation occurs due to the limited time of exposure to air or to the lack of information regarding the duration of air exposure., for the C4 stage it was considered a carbon dioxide uptake equal to 75 % of the maximum theoretical carbon dioxide uptake for landfilled wastes. No uptake was considered for recycled wastes., for the D stage it was considered a carbon dioxide uptake equal to 100 % of the maximum theoretical carbon dioxide uptake. The following values (evaluated according to stoichiometry) were used as maximum uptake values: Natural hydraulic lime: 440 kg/ton. It should be highlighted that since Miniera San Romedio produces ready mixed products and has no control and no information regarding their applications it was impossible, due to lack of data, to calculate the contribution of carbonation in the use stage (module B). Regarding the end-of-life of the packaging paper (100 % recyclable), it was not considered since beyond the boundaries of the system."

For as concerns the energy source to feed the furnace for the NHL production, hard coal, with a total heat evolution of 787 Mcal to cook 1 ton of NHL, was considered. For the internal transportations, gasoline with a calorific power of 45 MJ/kg was considered. For as concerns the end-of-life stage, the demolition, transport, treatment, and disposal of wastes were modelled using processes present in the Ecoinvent database and modified to the specific case. In particular, for the C1 stage (demolition/deconstruction) the use of a diesel operating machine with a productivity of 16.6 min/ton of demolished material and a diesel consumption of 0.9 lt/m3 was considered. A water consumption of 0.018 m3 /m3 was considered. Both references were taken from Ivanica et al., for the C2 stage a distance of 15 km was assumed according to the data provided by Italia del Riciclo and referring to the year 2021., for the C3 and C4 stages, despite the NHL-based mortars can be fully recycled and due to the lack of specific information regarding the end-of-life of this product, it was assumed that, after a sorting process, 78.1 wt% of inert wastes is recycled while the remaining part is landfilled (data provided by Italia del Riciclo and referring to the year 2021). For the sorting process an existing Ecoinvent process was adapted to the specific case., for the stage D it was considered that the secondary materials were used as alternative to gravel for the production of concrete and for road construction. Benefits and impacts associated with these operations were therefore evaluated. According to EN 16908:2017+A1 the carbonation of natural hydraulic lime, cement and hydrated lime can be very relevant after demolition with consistent carbon dioxide uptake. The evaluation of carbon dioxide uptake was carried out according to the procedure described in EN 16757. In particular, it was considered that: for the C1-C3 stages no carbonation occurs due to the limited time of exposure to air or to the lack of information regarding the duration of air exposure., for the C4 stage it was considered a carbon dioxide uptake equal to 75 % of the maximum theoretical carbon dioxide uptake for landfilled wastes. No uptake was considered for recycled wastes., for the D stage it was considered a carbon dioxide uptake equal to 100 % of the maximum theoretical carbon dioxide uptake. The following values (evaluated according to stoichiometry) were used as maximum uptake values: Natural hydraulic lime: 440 kg/ton. It should be highlighted that since Miniera San Romedio produces ready mixed products and has no control and no information regarding their applications it was impossible, due to lack of data, to calculate the contribution of carbonation in the use stage (module B). Regarding the end-of-life of the packaging paper (100 % recyclable), it was not considered since beyond the boundaries of the system."

The electrical energy is derived from renewable energy source (hydropower) that have obtained certification with the renewable energy certification. The electrical energy is converted from high voltage to low voltage using an electrical transformer located close to the plants. The certification of the renewability of the energy covers to whole period analysed in this study (2021-2022). For as concerns the energy source to feed the furnace for the NHL production, hard coal, with a total heat evolution of 787 Mcal to cook 1 ton of NHL, was considered. For the internal transportations, gasoline with a calorific power of 45 MJ/kg was considered. For as concerns the end-of-life stage, the demolition, transport, treatment, and disposal of wastes were modelled using processes present in the Ecoinvent database and modified to the specific case. In particular, for the C1 stage (demolition/deconstruction) the use of a diesel operating machine with a productivity of 16.6 min/ton of demolished material and a diesel consumption of 0.9 lt/m3 was considered. A water consumption of 0.018 m3 /m3 was considered. Both references were taken from Ivanica et al., for the C2 stage a distance of 15 km was assumed according to data provided by Italia del Riciclo referred to the year 2021., for the C3 and C4 stages, despite the NHL-based mortar can be fully recycled and due to the lack of specific information regarding the end-of-life of this product, it was assumed that, after a sorting and crushing process, 78.1 wt% of inert wastes is recycled (reaching the end-of-waste state) while the remaining part is landfilled (data provided by Italia del Riciclo referred to the year 2021). For the sorting and crushing process an existing Ecoinvent process was adapted to the specific case., for the stage D it was considered that the secondary materials were used as alternative to gravel for the production of concrete and for road construction (the background process used refers to the period 2013-2021). Benefits and impacts associated to these operations were therefore evaluated. According to EN 16908:2017+A1 the carbonation of natural hydraulic lime, cement and hydrated lime can be very relevant after demolition with consistent carbon dioxide uptake. The evaluation of carbon dioxide uptake was carried out according to the procedure described in EN 16757. In particular it was considered that: for the C1-C3 stages no carbonation occurs due to the limited time of exposure to air or to the lack of information regarding the duration of air exposure., for the C4 stage it was considered a carbon dioxide uptake equal to 75 % of the maximum theoretical carbon dioxide uptake for landfilled wastes. No uptake was considered for recycled wastes., for the D stage it was considered a carbon dioxide uptake equal to 100 % of the maximum theoretical carbon dioxide uptake. The following values (evaluated according to stoichiometry) were used as maximum uptake values: Natural hydraulic lime: 440 kg CO2/ton, Cement: 490 kg CO2/ton, It should be highlighted that since Miniera San Romedio produces ready mixed products and has no control and no information regarding their applications it was impossible, due to lack of data, to calculate the contribution of carbonation in the use stage (module B). Regarding the end-of-life of the packaging paper (100 % recyclable), it was not considered since beyond the boundaries of the system."

        "Szenariobeschreibung": "The electrical energy consumed in Miniera San Romedio Srl plants is a fully renewable certified energy. The electrical energy is derived from renewable energy source (hydropower) that have obtained certification with the renewable energy certification. The electrical energy is converted from high voltage to low voltage using an electrical transformer located close to the plants. The certification of the renewability of the energy covers to whole period analysed in this study (2021-2022). For as concerns the energy source to feed the furnace for the NHL production, hard coal, with a total heat evolution of 787 Mcal to cook 1 ton of NHL, was considered. For the internal transportations, gasoline with a calorific power of 45 MJ/kg was considered. For as concerns the end-of-life stage, the demolition, transport, treatment, and disposal of wastes were modelled using processes present in the Ecoinvent database and modified to the specific case. In particular, for the C1 stage (demolition/deconstruction) the use of a diesel operating machine with a productivity of 16.6 min/ton of demolished material and a diesel consumption of 0.9 lt/m3 was considered. A water consumption of 0.018 m3 /m3 was considered. Both references were taken from Ivanica et al., for the C2 stage a distance of 15 km was assumed according to data provided by Italia del Riciclo referred to the year 2021., for the C3 and C4 stages, despite the Mixed inert NHL mortar can be fully recycled and due to the lack of specific information regarding the end-of-life of this product, it was assumed that, after a sorting and crushing process, 78.1 wt% of inert wastes is recycled (reaching the end-of-waste state) while the remaining part is landfilled (data provided by Italia del Riciclo referred to the year 2021). For the sorting and crushing process an existing Ecoinvent process was adapted to the specific case., for the stage D it was considered that the secondary materials were used as alternative to gravel for the production of concrete and for road construction (the background process used refers to the period 2013-2021). Benefits and impacts associated to these operations were therefore evaluated. According to EN 16908:2017+A1 the carbonation of cement and natural hydraulic lime can be very relevant after demolition with consistent carbon dioxide uptake. The evaluation of carbon dioxide uptake was carried out according to the procedure described in EN 16757. In particular it was considered that: for the C1-C3 stages no carbonation occurs due to the limited time of exposure to air or to the lack of information regarding the duration of air exposure., for the C4 stage it was considered a carbon dioxide uptake equal to 75 % of the maximum theoretical carbon dioxide uptake for landfilled wastes. No uptake was considered for recycled wastes., for the D stage it was considered a carbon dioxide uptake equal to 100 % of the maximum theoretical carbon dioxide uptake. The following values (evaluated according to stoichiometry) were used as maximum uptake values: Natural hydraulic lime: 440 kg CO2/ton, Cement: 490 kg CO2/ton. It should be highlighted that since Miniera San Romedio produces ready mixed products and has no control and no information regarding their applications it was impossible, due to lack of data, to calculate the contribution of carbonation in the use stage (module B). Regarding the end-of-life of the packaging paper (100 % recyclable), it was not considered since beyond the boundaries of the system."

The certification of the renewability of the energy covers to whole period analysed in this study (2021-2022). For as concerns the energy source to feed the furnace for the NHL production, hard coal, with a total heat evolution of 787 Mcal to cook 1 ton of NHL, was considered. For the internal transportations, gasoline with a calorific power of 45 MJ/kg was considered. For as concerns the end-of-life stage, the demolition, transport, treatment, and disposal of wastes were modelled using processes present in the Ecoinvent database and modified to the specific case. In particular, for the C1 stage (demolition/deconstruction) the use of a diesel operating machine with a productivity of 16.6 min/ton of demolished material and a diesel consumption of 0.9 lt/m3 was considered. A water consumption of 0.018 m3 /m3 was considered. Both references were taken from Ivanica et al., for the C2 stage a distance of 15 km was assumed according to data provided by Italia del Riciclo referred to the year 2021., for the C3 and C4 stages, despite the Mixed inert NHL mortar can be fully recycled and due to the lack of specific information regarding the end-of-life of this product, it was assumed that, after a sorting and crushing process, 78.1 wt% of inert wastes is recycled (reaching the end-of-waste state) while the remaining part is landfilled (data provided by Italia del Riciclo referred to the year 2021). For the sorting and crushing process an existing Ecoinvent process was adapted to the specific case., for the stage D it was considered that the secondary materials were used as alternative to gravel for the production of concrete and for road construction (the background process used refers to the period 2013-2021). Benefits and impacts associated to these operations were therefore evaluated. According to EN 16908:2017+A1 the carbonation of cement and natural hydraulic lime can be very relevant after demolition with consistent carbon dioxide uptake. The evaluation of carbon dioxide uptake was carried out according to the procedure described in EN 16757. In particular it was considered that: for the C1-C3 stages no carbonation occurs due to the limited time of exposure to air or to the lack of information regarding the duration of air exposure., for the C4 stage it was considered a carbon dioxide uptake equal to 75 % of the maximum theoretical carbon dioxide uptake for landfilled wastes. No uptake was considered for recycled wastes., for the D stage it was considered a carbon dioxide uptake equal to 100 % of the maximum theoretical carbon dioxide uptake. The following values (evaluated according to stoichiometry) were used as maximum uptake values: Natural hydraulic lime: 440 kg CO2/ton, Cement: 490 kg CO2/ton. It should be highlighted that since Miniera San Romedio produces ready mixed products and has no control and no information regarding their applications it was impossible, due to lack of data, to calculate the contribution of carbonation in the use stage (module B). Regarding the end-of-life of the packaging paper (100 % recyclable), it was not considered since beyond the boundaries of the system."

The electrical energy is derived from renewable energy source (hydropower) that have obtained certification with the renewable energy certification.

The certification of the renewability of the energy covers to whole period analysed in this study (2021-2022). For as concerns the energy source to feed the furnace for the NHL production, hard coal, with a total heat evolution of 787 Mcal to cook 1 ton of NHL, was considered. For the internal transportations, gasoline with a calorific power of 45 MJ/kg was considered. For as concerns the end-of-life stage, the demolition, transport, treatment, and disposal of wastes were modelled using processes present in the Ecoinvent database and modified to the specific case. In particular, for the C1 stage (demolition/deconstruction) the use of a diesel operating machine with a productivity of 16.6 min/ton of demolished material and a diesel consumption of 0.9 lt/m3 was considered. A water consumption of 0.018 m3 /m3 was considered. Both references were taken from Ivanica et al., for the C2 stage a distance of 15 km was assumed according to data provided by Italia del Riciclo referred to the year 2021., for the C3 and C4 stages, according to the current Italian waste legislation on the ?end-of-waste of construction and demolition wastes? (D.M. 27 September 2022 n. 152) that allows the recovery of mixed wastes from demolition (CER category 170904, to which belongs Light Screed Floor once domolished) to be used for road construction works, backfilling, foundations, it was assumed that the Light screed floor can be fully recycled. Due to the lack of specific information regarding the end-of-life of this product, it was assumed that, after a sorting and crushing process, 78.1 wt% of inert wastes is recycled (reaching the end-of-waste state) while the remaining part is landfilled (data provided by Italia del Riciclo referred to the year 2021). For the sorting and crushing process an existing Ecoinvent process was adapted to the specific case., for the stage D it was considered that the secondary materials were used as alternative to gravel for the production of concrete and for road construction (the background process used refers to the period 2013-2021). Benefits and impacts associated to these operations were therefore evaluated. According to EN 16908:2017+A1 the carbonation of cement and natural hydraulic lime can be very relevant after demolition with consistent carbon dioxide uptake. The evaluation of carbon dioxide uptake was carried out according to the procedure described in EN 16757. In particular it was considered that: for the C1-C3 stages no carbonation occurs due to the limited time of exposure to air or to the lack of information regarding the duration of air exposure., for the C4 stage it was considered a carbon dioxide uptake equal to 75 % of the maximum theoretical carbon dioxide uptake for landfilled wastes. No uptake was considered for recycled wastes., for the D stage it was considered a carbon dioxide uptake equal to 100 % of the maximum theoretical carbon dioxide uptake. The following values (evaluated according to stoichiometry) were used as maximum uptake values: Natural hydraulic lime: 440 kg CO2/ton, Cement: 490 kg CO2/ton. It should be highlighted that since Miniera San Romedio produces ready mixed products and has no control and no information regarding their applications it was impossible, due to lack of data, to calculate the contribution of carbonation in the use stage (module B). Regarding the end-of-life of the packaging paper (100 % recyclable), it was not considered since beyond the boundaries of the system."

The fixed part means that this number is the same for each product in the product group and the scalable part is the part that depends on the mass per unit area of the product. In order to calculate the correct number of each environmental impact category for each of the products in the product group, the following calculation should be done: [number fixed part]+([specific mass]*[number scalable part]). The inputs slip agent masterbatch, thermoplastic elastomer and cardboard tube were not having a linear dependance on the specific mass, thus the higher amount of the product available was always considered for the scaling to be as conservative as possible. The inputs PP raw yarn, PP chips and PE chips did not have a linear dependence on the specific mass. As they are the main inputs present in the product, the linear dependence on the specific mass of the sum of these 3 inputs was calculated instead of considering the inputs separately. The linear dependence of the energy consumption on the specific mass has been calculated by taking into account the sum of the production energy and the yarn wisting energy (which is outsourced). For C1 the method and amount of the generic data set 'Polyester weefsel' from chapter 22.46 Grondwapening en grondscheiding of the DuboCalc programme (database version NMD 1.8 - 5.01.14052018) was used. In this generic data set, 0.0013h work per m² of geotextile was assumed."
