In cases, where datasets for chemical dispersion where not available, market for datasets where used, to include transport of the raw materials to the suppliers. Transport distances for all raw materials used (chemicals, packaging) could be recorded. A payload factor of 50% was used for all truck transports (suppliers, disposal transports and internal transports), which corresponds to a full delivery and empty return trip. A data set for a non-specific truck was used. Dr. Schutz GmbH purchases 100% renewable electricity. 2021 the share of renewable energy sources on the total renewable energy in Germany was as followed: Wind power: 53.6%, solar power 20.6%, biomass 18.5%, hydropower 7.3%. Based on this assumption an electricity data set was generated for the LCA calculation. No CO2 certificates were considered. For the third-party filler, no data on energy consumption was available, therefore it was assumed, that the energy consumption for crosslinker production is equally high as for the lacquer. As electricity source the German electricity mix was taken. According to the manufacturer, almost none processing waste occurs during production. Therefore, a generic value of 1% production waste was assumed, to cover low amounts of waste. Concerning construction waste, 15% was chosen, which is the recommendation of R<THiNK K for product from the category ?auxiliary and finishing materials?. Concerning the transport from manufacturer to place of use (A4), an average was calculated based on the distance of production location to the countries supplied. The installation process was calculated based on the information material on preparation of floors(compare https://www.dr-schutz.com/wp-content/uploads/TI_EN_002_Preparation_of_resilient_floorings_200814.pdf, https://www.dr-schutz.com/wp-content/uploads/PI_EN_PU_Anticolor_Marknomor_mat_em_180523.pdf). Based on the specific product information, two coating processes with 50 ml each were assumed. As the density of lacquer and crosslinker are almost 1g/ml, 100 g/m² for total process was taken for calculation. For installation phase (A5), and module C and D, Germany was chosen as location, as it is the main market area (compare chapter 2.3). According to the preparation guideline (https://www.dr-schutz.com/wp-content/uploads/TI_EN_002_Preparation_of_resilient_floorings_200814.pdf), a two-stage cleaning (first with a cleanser, second only water) is assumed. For the cleanser, a generic dataset from the ecoinvent database is taken (Cleaning consumables, without water, in 13.6% solution state (GLO)| market for), mixed in the ratio 1:5 and applied with an amount of 200 ml/per m². An overflow or unused portion of 15% of the prepared sealer is assumed during the installation process. As the floor covering is disposed as part of the flooring system, the demolition process is not considered as a load for the calculated system. Therefore, C1 is considered to be zero. For the production process waste, the ecoinvent scenario Spent solvent mixture {Europe without Switzerland}| treatment of spent solvent mixture, hazardous waste incineration | Cut-off, U was chosen, which assumes 100% incineration. For the plastic containers and bottles the NMD scenario plastics, via residue (NMD ID 43) was chosen, which assumes that 80% are incinerated, while 20% are landfilled. For the sealer itself, 100% incineration was assumed as waste scenario, which fits the waste treatment of PVC floor covering. The incineration loads were calculated using an ecoinvent dataset for waste paint. Note: The transport distances of the waste are based on the standard waste scenarios of the NMD Determination Method (SBK 2019): incineration 150 km/ recycling 50 km / landfill 100 km, vehicle: truck, unspecific. For energy recovery, only benefits for plastics were included, as the lower heating value of the chemicals was not available. According the EN 15804, loads are credited in A3 or C3 to C4 and benefits are credited in module D. For all transports, the environmental profile of a non-specific truck transport was used (conservative assumption): The vehicle operates with diesel, and it provides a fleet average that includes different lorry classes as well as EURO classes. This environmental profile contains data for transport, which is calculated for an average load factor, including empty return trips (EcoInvent 3.6)."

The certification of the renewability of the energy covers to whole period analysed in this study (2021-2022). For as concerns the energy source to feed the furnace for the NHL production, hard coal, with a total heat evolution of 787 Mcal to cook 1 ton of NHL, was considered. For the internal transportations, gasoline with a calorific power of 45 MJ/kg was considered. For as concerns the end-of-life stage, the demolition, transport, treatment, and disposal of wastes were modelled using processes present in the Ecoinvent database and modified to the specific case. In particular, for the C1 stage (demolition/deconstruction) the use of a diesel operating machine with a productivity of 16.6 min/ton of demolished material and a diesel consumption of 0.9 lt/m3 was considered. A water consumption of 0.018 m3 /m3 was considered. Both references were taken from Ivanica et al., for the C2 stage a distance of 15 km was assumed according to data provided by Italia del Riciclo referred to the year 2021., for the C3 and C4 stages, despite the NHL light plaster can be fully recycled and due to the lack of specific information regarding the end-of-life of this product, it was assumed that, after a sorting and crushing process, 78.1 wt% of inert wastes is recycled (reaching the end-of-waste state) while the remaining part is landfilled (data provided by Italia del Riciclo referred to the year 2021). For the sorting and crushing process an existing Ecoinvent process was adapted to the specific case., for the stage D it was considered that the secondary materials were used as alternative to gravel for the production of concrete and for road construction (the background process used refers to the period 2013-2021). Benefits and impacts associated to these operations were therefore evaluated. According to EN 16908:2017+A1 the carbonation of cement and natural hydraulic lime can be very relevant after demolition with consistent carbon dioxide uptake. The evaluation of carbon dioxide uptake was carried out according to the procedure described in EN 16757. In particular it was considered that: for the C1-C3 stages no carbonation occurs due to the limited time of exposure to air or to the lack of information regarding the duration of air exposure., for the C4 stage it was considered a carbon dioxide uptake equal to 75 % of the maximum theoretical carbon dioxide uptake for landfilled wastes. No uptake was considered for recycled wastes., for the D stage it was considered a carbon dioxide uptake equal to 100 % of the maximum theoretical carbon dioxide uptake. The following values (evaluated according to stoichiometry) were used as maximum uptake values: Natural hydraulic lime: 440 kg CO2/ton, Cement: 490 kg CO2/ton. It should be highlighted that since Miniera San Romedio produces ready mixed products and has no control and no information regarding their applications it was impossible, due to lack of data, to calculate the contribution of carbonation in the use stage (module B). Regarding the end-of-life of the packaging paper (100 % recyclable), it was not considered since beyond the boundaries of the system."

Both references were taken from Ivanica et al., for the C2 stage a distance of 15 km was assumed according to data provided by Italia del Riciclo referred to the year 2021., for the C3 and C4 stages, despite the NHL light plaster can be fully recycled and due to the lack of specific information regarding the end-of-life of this product, it was assumed that, after a sorting and crushing process, 78.1 wt% of inert wastes is recycled (reaching the end-of-waste state) while the remaining part is landfilled (data provided by Italia del Riciclo referred to the year 2021). For the sorting and crushing process an existing Ecoinvent process was adapted to the specific case., for the stage D it was considered that the secondary materials were used as alternative to gravel for the production of concrete and for road construction (the background process used refers to the period 2013-2021). Benefits and impacts associated to these operations were therefore evaluated. According to EN 16908:2017+A1 the carbonation of cement and natural hydraulic lime can be very relevant after demolition with consistent carbon dioxide uptake. The evaluation of carbon dioxide uptake was carried out according to the procedure described in EN 16757. In particular it was considered that: for the C1-C3 stages no carbonation occurs due to the limited time of exposure to air or to the lack of information regarding the duration of air exposure., for the C4 stage it was considered a carbon dioxide uptake equal to 75 % of the maximum theoretical carbon dioxide uptake for landfilled wastes. No uptake was considered for recycled wastes., for the D stage it was considered a carbon dioxide uptake equal to 100 % of the maximum theoretical carbon dioxide uptake. The following values (evaluated according to stoichiometry) were used as maximum uptake values: Natural hydraulic lime: 440 kg CO2/ton, Cement: 490 kg CO2/ton. It should be highlighted that since Miniera San Romedio produces ready mixed products and has no control and no information regarding their applications it was impossible, due to lack of data, to calculate the contribution of carbonation in the use stage (module B). Regarding the end-of-life of the packaging paper (100 % recyclable), it was not considered since beyond the boundaries of the system."

Both references were taken from Ivanica et al., for the C2 stage a distance of 15 km was assumed according to data provided by Italia del Riciclo referred to the year 2021., for the C3 and C4 stages, despite the Waterproof NHL mortar can be fully recycled and due to the lack of specific information regarding the end-of-life of this product, it was assumed that, after a sorting and crushing process, 78.1 wt% of inert wastes is recycled (reaching the end-of-waste state) while the remaining part is landfilled (data provided by Italia del Riciclo referred to the year 2021). For the sorting and crushing process an existing Ecoinvent process was adapted to the specific case., for the stage D it was considered that the secondary materials were used as alternative to gravel for the production of concrete and for road construction (the background process used refers to the period 2013-2021). Benefits and impacts associated to these operations were therefore evaluated. According to EN 16908:2017+A1 the carbonation of cement and natural hydraulic lime can be very relevant after demolition with consistent carbon dioxide uptake. The evaluation of carbon dioxide uptake was carried out according to the procedure described in EN 16757. In particular it was considered that: for the C1-C3 stages no carbonation occurs due to the limited time of exposure to air or to the lack of information regarding the duration of air exposure., for the C4 stage it was considered a carbon dioxide uptake equal to 75 % of the maximum theoretical carbon dioxide uptake for landfilled wastes. No uptake was considered for recycled wastes., for the D stage it was considered a carbon dioxide uptake equal to 100 % of the maximum theoretical carbon dioxide uptake. The following values (evaluated according to stoichiometry) were used as maximum uptake values: Natural hydraulic lime: 440 kg CO2/ton, Cement: 490 kg CO2/ton. It should be highlighted that since Miniera San Romedio produces ready mixed products and has no control and no information regarding their applications it was impossible, due to lack of data, to calculate the contribution of carbonation in the use stage (module B). Regarding the end-of-life of the packaging paper (100 % recyclable), it was not considered since beyond the boundaries of the system."

For the third-party filler, no data on energy consumption was available, therefore it was assumed, that the energy consumption for crosslinker production is equally high as for the lacquer.

As the floor covering is disposed as part of the flooring system, the demolition process is not considered as a load for the calculated system. Therefore, C1 is considered to be zero. For the production process waste, the EcoInvent scenario Spent solvent mixture {Europe without Switzerland}| treatment of spent solvent mixture, hazardous waste incineration | Cut-off, U was chosen, which assumes 100% incineration. For the plastic containers and bottles the NMD scenario plastics, via residue (NMD ID 43) was chosen, which assumes that 80% are incinerated, while 20% are landfilled.

A payload factor of 50% was used for all truck transports (suppliers, disposal transports and internal transports), which corresponds to a full delivery and empty return trip. A data set for a non-specific truck was used. Dr. Schutz GmbH purchases 100% renewable electricity. 2021 the share of renewable energy sources on the total renewable energy in Germany was as followed: Wind power: 53.6%, solar power 20.6%, biomass 18.5%, hydropower 7.3%. Based on this assumption an electricity data set was generated for the LCA calculation. No CO2 certificates were considered. For the third-party filler, no data on energy consumption was available, therefore it was assumed, that the energy consumption for crosslinker production is equally high as for the lacquer. As electricity source the German electricity mix was taken. According to the manufacturer, almost none processing waste occurs during production. Therefore, a generic value of 1% production waste was assumed, to cover low amounts of waste. Concerning construction waste, 15% was chosen, which is the recommendation of R<THiNK for product from the category ?auxiliary and finishing materials?. Concerning the transport from manufacturer to place of use (A4), an average was calculated based on the distance of production location to the countries supplied. The installation process was calculated based on the information material on preparation of floors (compare https://www.dr-schutz.com/wp-content/uploads/TI_EN_002_Preparation_of_resilient_floorings_200814.pdf, https://www.dr-schutz.com/wp-content/uploads/PI_EN_strato_484_200526.pdf). Based on the specific product information, one coating processes with 100 ml was assumed. As the density of lacquer and crosslinker are almost 1g/ml, 100 g/m² for total process was taken for calculation. For installation phase (A5), and module C and D, Germany was chosen as location, as it is the main market area (compare chapter 2.3). ccording to the preparation guideline (https://www.dr-schutz.com/wp-content/uploads/TI_EN_002_Preparation_of_resilient_floorings_200814.pdf), a two-stage cleaning (first with a cleanser, second only water) is assumed. For the cleanser, a generic dataset from the ecoinvent database is taken (Cleaning consumables, without water, in 13.6% solution state (GLO)| market for), mixed in the ratio 1:5 and applied with an amount of 200 ml/per m². An overflow or unused portion of 15% of the prepared sealer is assumed during the installation process. As the floor covering is disposed as part of the flooring system, the demolition process is not considered as a load for the calculated system. Therefore, C1 is considered to be zero. For the production process waste, the EcoInvent scenario Spent solvent mixture {Europe without Switzerland}| treatment of spent solvent mixture, hazardous waste incineration | Cut-off, U was chosen, which assumes 100% incineration. For the plastic containers and bottles the NMD scenario plastics, via residue (NMD ID 43) was chosen, which assumes that 80% are incinerated, while 20% are landfilled. For the sealer itself, 100% incineration was assumed as waste scenario, which fits the waste treatment of PVC floor covering. The incineration loads were calculated using an EcoInvent dataset for waste paint. Note: The transport distances of the waste are based on the standard waste scenarios of the NMD Determination Method (SBK 2019): incineration 150 km/ recycling 50 km / landfill 100 km, vehicle: truck, unspecific. For energy recovery, only benefits for plastics were included, as the lower heating value of the chemicals was not available. According the EN 15804, loads are credited in A3 or C3 to C4 and benefits are credited in module D. For all transports, the environmental profile of a non-specific truck transport was used (conservative assumption): The vehicle operates with diesel, and it provides a fleet average that includes different lorry classes as well as EURO classes. This environmental profile contains data for transport, which is calculated for an average load factor, including empty return trips (EcoInvent 3.6)."

The electrical energy is derived from renewable energy source (hydropower) that have obtained certification with the renewable energy certification. The electrical energy is converted from high voltage to low voltage using an electrical transformer located close to the plants. The certification of the renewability of the energy covers to whole period analysed in this study (2021-2022). For as concerns the energy source to feed the furnace for the NHL production, hard coal, with a total heat evolution of 787 Mcal to cook 1 ton of NHL, was considered. For the internal transportations, gasoline with a calorific power of 45 MJ/kg was considered. For as concerns the end-of-life stage, the demolition, transport, treatment, and disposal of wastes were modelled using processes present in the Ecoinvent database and modified to the specific case. In particular, for the C1 stage (demolition/deconstruction) the use of a diesel operating machine with a productivity of 16.6 min/ton of demolished material and a diesel consumption of 0.9 lt/m3 was considered. A water consumption of 0.018 m3 /m3 was considered. Both references were taken from Ivanica et al., for the C2 stage a distance of 15 km was assumed according to data provided by Italia del Riciclo referred to the year 2021., for the C3 and C4 stages, despite the NHL-based light plaster can be fully recycled and due to the lack of specific information regarding the end-of-life of this product, it was assumed that, after a sorting and crushing process, 78.1 wt% of inert wastes is recycled (reaching the end-of-waste state) while the remaining part is landfilled (data provided by Italia del Riciclo referred to the year 2021). For the sorting and crushing process an existing Ecoinvent process was adapted to the specific case., for the stage D it was considered that the secondary materials were used as alternative to gravel for the production of concrete and for road construction (the background process used refers to the period 2013-2021). Benefits and impacts associated to these operations were therefore evaluated. According to EN 16908:2017+A1 the carbonation of cement and natural hydraulic lime can be very relevant after demolition with consistent carbon dioxide uptake. The evaluation of carbon dioxide uptake was carried out according to the procedure described in EN 16757. In particular it was considered that: for the C1-C3 stages no carbonation occurs due to the limited time of exposure to air or to the lack of information regarding the duration of air exposure., for the C4 stage it was considered a carbon dioxide uptake equal to 75 % of the maximum theoretical carbon dioxide uptake for landfilled wastes. No uptake was considered for recycled wastes., for the D stage it was considered a carbon dioxide uptake equal to 100 % of the maximum theoretical carbon dioxide uptake. The following values (evaluated according to stoichiometry) were used as maximum uptake values: Natural hydraulic lime: 440 kg CO2/ton, Cement: 490 kg CO2/ton. It should be highlighted that since Miniera San Romedio produces ready mixed products and has no control and no information regarding their applications it was impossible, due to lack of data, to calculate the contribution of carbonation in the use stage (module B). Regarding the end-of-life of the packaging paper (100 % recyclable), it was not considered since beyond the boundaries of the system."

The certification of the renewability of the energy covers to whole period analysed in this study (2021-2022). For as concerns the energy source to feed the furnace for the NHL production, hard coal, with a total heat evolution of 787 Mcal to cook 1 ton of NHL, was considered. For the internal transportations, gasoline with a calorific power of 45 MJ/kg was considered. For as concerns the end-of-life stage, the demolition, transport, treatment, and disposal of wastes were modelled using processes present in the Ecoinvent database and modified to the specific case. In particular, for the C1 stage (demolition/deconstruction) the use of a diesel operating machine with a productivity of 16.6 min/ton of demolished material and a diesel consumption of 0.9 lt/m3 was considered. A water consumption of 0.018 m3 /m3 was considered. Both references were taken from Ivanica et al., for the C2 stage a distance of 15 km was assumed according to data provided by Italia del Riciclo referred to the year 2021., for the C3 and C4 stages, despite the NHL-based light plaster can be fully recycled and due to the lack of specific information regarding the end-of-life of this product, it was assumed that, after a sorting and crushing process, 78.1 wt% of inert wastes is recycled (reaching the end-of-waste state) while the remaining part is landfilled (data provided by Italia del Riciclo referred to the year 2021). For the sorting and crushing process an existing Ecoinvent process was adapted to the specific case., for the stage D it was considered that the secondary materials were used as alternative to gravel for the production of concrete and for road construction (the background process used refers to the period 2013-2021). Benefits and impacts associated to these operations were therefore evaluated. According to EN 16908:2017+A1 the carbonation of cement and natural hydraulic lime can be very relevant after demolition with consistent carbon dioxide uptake. The evaluation of carbon dioxide uptake was carried out according to the procedure described in EN 16757. In particular it was considered that: for the C1-C3 stages no carbonation occurs due to the limited time of exposure to air or to the lack of information regarding the duration of air exposure., for the C4 stage it was considered a carbon dioxide uptake equal to 75 % of the maximum theoretical carbon dioxide uptake for landfilled wastes. No uptake was considered for recycled wastes., for the D stage it was considered a carbon dioxide uptake equal to 100 % of the maximum theoretical carbon dioxide uptake. The following values (evaluated according to stoichiometry) were used as maximum uptake values: Natural hydraulic lime: 440 kg CO2/ton, Cement: 490 kg CO2/ton. It should be highlighted that since Miniera San Romedio produces ready mixed products and has no control and no information regarding their applications it was impossible, due to lack of data, to calculate the contribution of carbonation in the use stage (module B). Regarding the end-of-life of the packaging paper (100 % recyclable), it was not considered since beyond the boundaries of the system."

Transport distances for all raw materials used (chemicals, packaging) could be recorded. A payload factor of 50% was used for all truck transports (suppliers, disposal transports and internal transports), which corresponds to a full delivery and empty return trip. A data set for a non-specific truck was used. Dr. Schutz GmbH purchases 100% renewable electricity. 2021 the share of renewable energy sources on the total renewable energy in Germany was as followed: Wind power: 53.6%, solar power 20.6%, biomass 18.5%, hydropower 7.3%. Based on this assumption an electricity data set was generated for the LCA calculation. No CO2 certificates were considered. For the third-party filler, no data on energy consumption was available, therefore it was assumed, that the energy consumption for crosslinker production is equally high as for the lacquer. As electricity source the German electricity mix was taken. According to the manufacturer, almost none processing waste occurs during production. Therefore, a generic value of 1% production waste was assumed, to cover low amounts of waste. Concerning construction waste, 15% was chosen, which is the recommendation of R<THiNK for product from the category ?auxiliary and finishing materials?. Concerning the transport from manufacturer to place of use (A4), an average was calculated based on the distance of production location to the countries supplied. The installation process was calculated based on the information material on preparation of floors(compare https://www.dr-schutz.com/wp-content/uploads/TI_EN_002_Preparation_of_resilient_floorings_200814.pdf, https://www.dr-schutz.com/wp-content/uploads/PI_EN_PU_Anticolor_Marknomor_mat_em_180523.pdf). Based on the specific product information, two coating processes with 50 ml each were assumed. As the density of lacquer and crosslinker are almost 1g/ml, 100 g/m² for total process was taken for calculation. For installation phase (A5), and module C and D, Germany was chosen as location, as it is the main market area (compare chapter 2.3). According to the preparation guideline (https://www.dr-schutz.com/wp-content/uploads/TI_EN_002_Preparation_of_resilient_floorings_200814.pdf), a two-stage cleaning (first with a cleanser, second only water) is assumed. For the cleanser, a generic dataset from the ecoinvent database is taken (Cleaning consumables, without water, in 13.6% solution state (GLO)| market for), mixed in the ratio 1:5 and applied with an amount of 200 ml/per m². An overflow or unused portion of 15% of the prepared sealer is assumed during the installation process. As the floor covering is disposed as part of the flooring system, the demolition process is not considered as a load for the calculated system. Therefore, C1 is considered to be zero. For the production process waste, the ecoinvent scenario Spent solvent mixture {Europe without Switzerland}| treatment of spent solvent mixture, hazardous waste incineration | Cut-off, U was chosen, which assumes 100% incineration. For the plastic containers and bottles the NMD scenario plastics, via residue (NMD ID 43) was chosen, which assumes that 80% are incinerated, while 20% are landfilled. For the sealer itself, 100% incineration was assumed as waste scenario, which fits the waste treatment of PVC floor covering. The incineration loads were calculated using an ecoinvent dataset for waste paint. Note: The transport distances of the waste are based on the standard waste scenarios of the NMD Determination Method (SBK 2019): incineration 150 km/ recycling 50 km / landfill 100 km, vehicle: truck, unspecific. For energy recovery, only benefits for plastics were included, as the lower heating value of the chemicals was not available. According the EN 15804, loads are credited in A3 or C3 to C4 and benefits are credited in module D. For all transports, the environmental profile of a non-specific truck transport was used (conservative assumption): The vehicle operates with diesel, and it provides a fleet average that includes different lorry classes as well as EURO classes. This environmental profile contains data for transport, which is calculated for an average load factor, including empty return trips (EcoInvent 3.6)."

According to the preparation guideline (https://www.dr-schutz.com/wp-content/uploads/TI_EN_002_Preparation_of_resilient_floorings_200814.pdf), a two-stage cleaning (first with a cleanser, second only water) is assumed. For the cleanser, a generic dataset from the ecoinvent database is taken (Cleaning consumables, without water, in 13.6% solution state (GLO)| market for), mixed in the ratio 1:5 and applied with an amount of 200 ml/per m². An overflow or unused portion of 15% of the prepared sealer is assumed during the installation process. As the floor covering is disposed as part of the flooring system, the demolition process is not considered as a load for the calculated system. Therefore, C1 is considered to be zero. For the production process waste, the ecoinvent scenario Spent solvent mixture {Europe without Switzerland}| treatment of spent solvent mixture, hazardous waste incineration | Cut-off, U was chosen, which assumes 100% incineration. For the plastic containers and bottles the NMD scenario plastics, via residue (NMD ID 43) was chosen, which assumes that 80% are incinerated, while 20% are landfilled. For the sealer itself, 100% incineration was assumed as waste scenario, which fits the waste treatment of PVC floor covering. The incineration loads were calculated using an ecoinvent dataset for waste paint. Note: The transport distances of the waste are based on the standard waste scenarios of the NMD Determination Method (SBK 2019): incineration 150 km/ recycling 50 km / landfill 100 km, vehicle: truck, unspecific. For energy recovery, only benefits for plastics were included, as the lower heating value of the chemicals was not available. According the EN 15804, loads are credited in A3 or C3 to C4 and benefits are credited in module D. For all transports, the environmental profile of a non-specific truck transport was used (conservative assumption): The vehicle operates with diesel, and it provides a fleet average that includes different lorry classes as well as EURO classes. This environmental profile contains data for transport, which is calculated for an average load factor, including empty return trips (EcoInvent 3.6)."

A payload factor of 50% was used for all truck transports (suppliers, disposal transports and internal transports), which corresponds to a full delivery and empty return trip. A data set for a non-specific truck was used. Dr. Schutz GmbH purchases 100% renewable electricity. 2021 the share of renewable energy sources on the total renewable energy in Germany was as followed: Wind power: 53.6%, solar power 20.6%, biomass 18.5%, hydropower 7.3%. Based on this assumption an electricity data set was generated for the LCA calculation. No CO2 certificates were considered. For the third-party filler, no data on energy consumption was available, therefore it was assumed, that the energy consumption for crosslinker production is equally high as for the lacquer. As electricity source the German electricity mix was taken. According to the manufacturer, almost none processing waste occurs during production. Therefore, a generic value of 1% production waste was assumed, to cover low amounts of waste. Concerning construction waste, 15% was chosen, which is the recommendation of R<THiNK for product from the category ?auxiliary and finishing materials?. Concerning the transport from manufacturer to place of use (A4), an average was calculated based on the distance of production location to the countries supplied. The installation process was calculated based on the information material on preparation of floors(compare https://www.dr-schutz.com/wp-content/uploads/TI_EN_002_Preparation_of_resilient_floorings_200814.pdf, https://www.dr-schutz.com/wp-content/uploads/PI_EN_PU_Anticolor_Marknomor_mat_em_180523.pdf). Based on the specific product information, two coating processes with 50 ml each were assumed. As the density of lacquer and crosslinker are almost 1g/ml, 100 g/m² for total process was taken for calculation. For installation phase (A5), and module C and D, Germany was chosen as location, as it is the main market area (compare chapter 2.3). According to the preparation guideline (https://www.dr-schutz.com/wp-content/uploads/TI_EN_002_Preparation_of_resilient_floorings_200814.pdf), a two-stage cleaning (first with a cleanser, second only water) is assumed. For the cleanser, a generic dataset from the ecoinvent database is taken (Cleaning consumables, without water, in 13.6% solution state (GLO)| market for), mixed in the ratio 1:5 and applied with an amount of 200 ml/per m². An overflow or unused portion of 15% of the prepared sealer is assumed during the installation process. As the floor covering is disposed as part of the flooring system, the demolition process is not considered as a load for the calculated system. Therefore, C1 is considered to be zero. For the production process waste, the ecoinvent scenario Spent solvent mixture {Europe without Switzerland}| treatment of spent solvent mixture, hazardous waste incineration | Cut-off, U was chosen, which assumes 100% incineration. For the plastic containers and bottles the NMD scenario plastics, via residue (NMD ID 43) was chosen, which assumes that 80% are incinerated, while 20% are landfilled. For the sealer itself, 100% incineration was assumed as waste scenario, which fits the waste treatment of PVC floor covering. The incineration loads were calculated using an ecoinvent dataset for waste paint. Note: The transport distances of the waste are based on the standard waste scenarios of the NMD Determination Method (SBK 2019): incineration 150 km/ recycling 50 km / landfill 100 km, vehicle: truck, unspecific. For energy recovery, only benefits for plastics were included, as the lower heating value of the chemicals was not available. According the EN 15804, loads are credited in A3 or C3 to C4 and benefits are credited in module D. For all transports, the environmental profile of a non-specific truck transport was used (conservative assumption): The vehicle operates with diesel, and it provides a fleet average that includes different lorry classes as well as EURO classes. This environmental profile contains data for transport, which is calculated for an average load factor, including empty return trips (EcoInvent 3.6)."

The certification of the renewability of the energy covers to whole period analysed in this study (2021-2022). For as concerns the energy source to feed the furnace for the NHL production, hard coal, with a total heat evolution of 787 Mcal to cook 1 ton of NHL, was considered. For the internal transportations, gasoline with a calorific power of 45 MJ/kg was considered. For as concerns the end-of-life stage, the demolition, transport, treatment, and disposal of wastes were modelled using processes present in the Ecoinvent database and modified to the specific case. In particular, for the C1 stage (demolition/deconstruction) the use of a diesel operating machine with a productivity of 16.6 min/ton of demolished material and a diesel consumption of 0.9 lt/m3 was considered. A water consumption of 0.018 m3 /m3 was considered. Both references were taken from Ivanica et al., for the C2 stage a distance of 15 km was assumed according to data provided by Italia del Riciclo referred to the year 2021., for the C3 and C4 stages, despite the NHL light mortar can be fully recycled and due to the lack of specific information regarding the end-of-life of this product, it was assumed that, after a sorting and crushing process, 78.1 wt% of inert wastes is recycled (reaching the end-of-waste state) while the remaining part is landfilled (data provided by Italia del Riciclo referred to the year 2021). For the sorting and crushing process an existing Ecoinvent process was adapted to the specific case., for the stage D it was considered that the secondary materials were used as alternative to gravel for the production of concrete and for road construction (the background process used refers to the period 2013-2021). Benefits and impacts associated to these operations were therefore evaluated. According to EN 16908:2017+A1 the carbonation of cement and natural hydraulic lime can be very relevant after demolition with consistent carbon dioxide uptake. The evaluation of carbon dioxide uptake was carried out according to the procedure described in EN 16757. In particular it was considered that: for the C1-C3 stages no carbonation occurs due to the limited time of exposure to air or to the lack of information regarding the duration of air exposure., for the C4 stage it was considered a carbon dioxide uptake equal to 75 % of the maximum theoretical carbon dioxide uptake for landfilled wastes. No uptake was considered for recycled wastes., for the D stage it was considered a carbon dioxide uptake equal to 100 % of the maximum theoretical carbon dioxide uptake. The following values (evaluated according to stoichiometry) were used as maximum uptake values: Natural hydraulic lime: 440 kg CO2/ton, Cement: 490 kg CO2/ton. It should be highlighted that since Miniera San Romedio produces ready mixed products and has no control and no information regarding their applications it was impossible, due to lack of data, to calculate the contribution of carbonation in the use stage (module B). Regarding the end-of-life of the packaging paper (100 % recyclable), it was not considered since beyond the boundaries of the system."

The following values (evaluated according to stoichiometry) were used as maximum uptake values: Natural hydraulic lime: 440 kg CO2/ton, Cement: 490 kg CO2/ton. It should be highlighted that since Miniera San Romedio produces ready mixed products and has no control and no information regarding their applications it was impossible, due to lack of data, to calculate the contribution of carbonation in the use stage (module B). Regarding the end-of-life of the packaging paper (100 % recyclable), it was not considered since beyond the boundaries of the system."

        "Szenariobeschreibung": "The electrical energy consumed in Miniera San Romedio Srl plants is a fully renewable certified energy. The electrical energy is derived from renewable energy source (hydropower) that have obtained certification with the renewable energy certification. The electrical energy is converted from high voltage to low voltage using an electrical transformer located close to the plants. The certification of the renewability of the energy covers to whole period analysed in this study (2021-2022). For as concerns the energy source to feed the furnace for the NHL production, hard coal, with a total heat evolution of 787 Mcal to cook 1 ton of NHL, was considered. For the internal transportations, gasoline with a calorific power of 45 MJ/kg was considered. For as concerns the end-of-life stage, the demolition, transport, treatment, and disposal of wastes were modelled using processes present in the Ecoinvent database and modified to the specific case. In particular, for the C1 stage (demolition/deconstruction) the use of a diesel operating machine with a productivity of 16.6 min/ton of demolished material and a diesel consumption of 0.9 lt/m3 was considered. A water consumption of 0.018 m3 /m3 was considered. Both references were taken from Ivanica et al., for the C2 stage a distance of 15 km was assumed according to data provided by Italia del Riciclo referred to the year 2021., for the C3 and C4 stages, despite the NHL light mortar can be fully recycled and due to the lack of specific information regarding the end-of-life of this product, it was assumed that, after a sorting and crushing process, 78.1 wt% of inert wastes is recycled (reaching the end-of-waste state) while the remaining part is landfilled (data provided by Italia del Riciclo referred to the year 2021). For the sorting and crushing process an existing Ecoinvent process was adapted to the specific case., for the stage D it was considered that the secondary materials were used as alternative to gravel for the production of concrete and for road construction (the background process used refers to the period 2013-2021). Benefits and impacts associated to these operations were therefore evaluated. According to EN 16908:2017+A1 the carbonation of cement and natural hydraulic lime can be very relevant after demolition with consistent carbon dioxide uptake. The evaluation of carbon dioxide uptake was carried out according to the procedure described in EN 16757. In particular it was considered that: for the C1-C3 stages no carbonation occurs due to the limited time of exposure to air or to the lack of information regarding the duration of air exposure., for the C4 stage it was considered a carbon dioxide uptake equal to 75 % of the maximum theoretical carbon dioxide uptake for landfilled wastes. No uptake was considered for recycled wastes., for the D stage it was considered a carbon dioxide uptake equal to 100 % of the maximum theoretical carbon dioxide uptake. The following values (evaluated according to stoichiometry) were used as maximum uptake values: Natural hydraulic lime: 440 kg CO2/ton, Cement: 490 kg CO2/ton.

For disposal, a waste scenario for \"MDF\" based on the NMD waste scenario ID 36 from the Netherlands was adapted and used for Germany. Here, 5 % landfilling and 95 % incineration were assumed. For the distance to waste treatment, 100 km for landfilling and 150 km for incineration were used with \"market group for transport, freight, lorry, unspecified {GLO}\" (from Ecoinvent 3.6). The energy saving (credit) from incineration was adjusted for the German market. For the landfill loads, \"99% Waste wood, untreated and 1% Waste paint {EU}| treatment of, sanitary landfill\" was used and for the incineration \"Waste building wood, chrome preserved {CH}| treatment of, municipal incineration\"."

For the internal transportations, gasoline with a calorific power of 45 MJ/kg was considered. For as concerns the end-of-life stage, the demolition, transport, treatment, and disposal of wastes were modelled using processes present in the Ecoinvent database and modified to the specific case. In particular, for the C1 stage (demolition/deconstruction) the use of a diesel operating machine with a productivity of 16.6 min/ton of demolished material and a diesel consumption of 0.9 lt/m3 was considered.

Benefits and impacts associated to these operations were therefore evaluated. According to EN 16908:2017+A1 the carbonation of natural hydraulic lime, cement and hydrated lime can be very relevant after demolition with consistent carbon dioxide uptake. The evaluation of carbon dioxide uptake was carried out according to the procedure described in EN 16757. In particular it was considered that: for the C1-C3 stages no carbonation occurs due to the limited time of exposure to air or to the lack of information regarding the duration of air exposure., for the C4 stage it was considered a carbon dioxide uptake equal to 75 % of the maximum theoretical carbon dioxide uptake for landfilled wastes. No uptake was considered for recycled wastes., for the D stage it was considered a carbon dioxide uptake equal to 100 % of the maximum theoretical carbon dioxide uptake. The following values (evaluated according to stoichiometry) were used as maximum uptake values: Natural hydraulic lime: 440 kg CO2/ton. It should be highlighted that since Miniera San Romedio produces ready mixed products and has no control and no information regarding their applications it was impossible, due to lack of data, to calculate the contribution of carbonation in the use stage (module B). Regarding the end-of-life of the packaging paper (100 % recyclable), it was not considered since beyond the boundaries of the system."

The electrical energy is derived from renewable energy source (hydropower) that have obtained certification with the renewable energy certification. The electrical energy is converted from high voltage to low voltage using an electrical transformer located close to the plants. The certification of the renewability of the energy covers to whole period analysed in this study (2021-2022). For as concerns the energy source to feed the furnace for the NHL production, hard coal, with a total heat evolution of 787 Mcal to cook 1 ton of NHL, was considered. For the internal transportations, gasoline with a calorific power of 45 MJ/kg was considered. For as concerns the end-of-life stage, the demolition, transport, treatment, and disposal of wastes were modelled using processes present in the Ecoinvent database and modified to the specific case. In particular, for the C1 stage (demolition/deconstruction) the use of a diesel operating machine with a productivity of 16.6 min/ton of demolished material and a diesel consumption of 0.9 lt/m3 was considered. A water consumption of 0.018 m3 /m3 was considered. Both references were taken from Ivanica et al., for the C2 stage a distance of 15 km was assumed according to data provided by Italia del Riciclo referred to the year 2021., for the C3 and C4 stages, despite the NHL heavy mortar can be fully recycled and due to the lack of specific information regarding the end-of-life of this product, it was assumed that, after a sorting and crushing process, 78.1 wt% of inert wastes is recycled (reaching the end-of-waste state) while the remaining part is landfilled (data provided by Italia del Riciclo referred to the year 2021). For the sorting and crushing process an existing Ecoinvent process was adapted to the specific case., for the stage D it was considered that the secondary materials were used as alternative to gravel for the production of concrete and for road construction (the background process used refers to the period 2013-2021). Benefits and impacts associated to these operations were therefore evaluated. According to EN 16908:2017+A1 the carbonation of natural hydraulic lime, cement and hydrated lime can be very relevant after demolition with consistent carbon dioxide uptake. The evaluation of carbon dioxide uptake was carried out according to the procedure described in EN 16757. In particular it was considered that: for the C1-C3 stages no carbonation occurs due to the limited time of exposure to air or to the lack of information regarding the duration of air exposure., for the C4 stage it was considered a carbon dioxide uptake equal to 75 % of the maximum theoretical carbon dioxide uptake for landfilled wastes. No uptake was considered for recycled wastes., for the D stage it was considered a carbon dioxide uptake equal to 100 % of the maximum theoretical carbon dioxide uptake. The following values (evaluated according to stoichiometry) were used as maximum uptake values: Natural hydraulic lime: 440 kg CO2/ton. It should be highlighted that since Miniera San Romedio produces ready mixed products and has no control and no information regarding their applications it was impossible, due to lack of data, to calculate the contribution of carbonation in the use stage (module B). Regarding the end-of-life of the packaging paper (100 % recyclable), it was not considered since beyond the boundaries of the system."

In particular, for the C1 stage (demolition/deconstruction) the use of a diesel operating machine with a productivity of 16.6 min/ton of demolished material and a diesel consumption of 0.9 lt/m3 was considered. A water consumption of 0.018 m3 /m3 was considered. Both references were taken from Ivanica et al., for the C2 stage a distance of 15 km was assumed according to data provided by Italia del Riciclo referred to the year 2021., for the C3 and C4 stages, despite the NHL heavy mortar can be fully recycled and due to the lack of specific information regarding the end-of-life of this product, it was assumed that, after a sorting and crushing process, 78.1 wt% of inert wastes is recycled (reaching the end-of-waste state) while the remaining part is landfilled (data provided by Italia del Riciclo referred to the year 2021). For the sorting and crushing process an existing Ecoinvent process was adapted to the specific case., for the stage D it was considered that the secondary materials were used as alternative to gravel for the production of concrete and for road construction (the background process used refers to the period 2013-2021). Benefits and impacts associated to these operations were therefore evaluated. According to EN 16908:2017+A1 the carbonation of natural hydraulic lime, cement and hydrated lime can be very relevant after demolition with consistent carbon dioxide uptake. The evaluation of carbon dioxide uptake was carried out according to the procedure described in EN 16757. In particular it was considered that: for the C1-C3 stages no carbonation occurs due to the limited time of exposure to air or to the lack of information regarding the duration of air exposure., for the C4 stage it was considered a carbon dioxide uptake equal to 75 % of the maximum theoretical carbon dioxide uptake for landfilled wastes. No uptake was considered for recycled wastes., for the D stage it was considered a carbon dioxide uptake equal to 100 % of the maximum theoretical carbon dioxide uptake. The following values (evaluated according to stoichiometry) were used as maximum uptake values: Natural hydraulic lime: 440 kg CO2/ton. It should be highlighted that since Miniera San Romedio produces ready mixed products and has no control and no information regarding their applications it was impossible, due to lack of data, to calculate the contribution of carbonation in the use stage (module B). Regarding the end-of-life of the packaging paper (100 % recyclable), it was not considered since beyond the boundaries of the system."

The following values (evaluated according to stoichiometry) were used as maximum uptake values: Cement: 490 kg CO2/ton, Hydrated lime: 594 kg CO2/ton. It should be highlighted that since Miniera San Romedio produces ready mixed products and has no control and no information regarding their applications it was impossible, due to lack of data, to calculate the contribution of carbonation in the use stage (module B). Regarding the end-of-life of the packaging paper (100 % recyclable), it was not considered since beyond the boundaries of the system."

The certification of the renewability of the energy covers to whole period analysed in this study (2021-2022). For as concerns the energy source to feed the furnace for the NHL production, hard coal, with a total heat evolution of 787 Mcal to cook 1 ton of NHL, was considered. For the internal transportations, gasoline with a calorific power of 45 MJ/kg was considered. For as concerns the end-of-life stage, the demolition, transport, treatment, and disposal of wastes were modelled using processes present in the Ecoinvent database and modified to the specific case. In particular, for the C1 stage (demolition/deconstruction) the use of a diesel operating machine with a productivity of 16.6 min/ton of demolished material and a diesel consumption of 0.9 lt/m3 was considered. A water consumption of 0.018 m3 /m3 was considered. Both references were taken from Ivanica et al., for the C2 stage a distance of 15 km was assumed according to data provided by Italia del Riciclo referred to the year 2021., for the C3 and C4 stages, despite the NHL injection mortar can be fully recycled and due to the lack of specific information regarding the end-of-life of this product, it was assumed that, after a sorting and crushing process, 78.1 wt% of inert wastes is recycled (reaching the end-of-waste state) while the remaining part is landfilled (data provided by Italia del Riciclo referred to the year 2021). For the sorting and crushing process an existing Ecoinvent process was adapted to the specific case., for the stage D it was considered that the secondary materials were used as alternative to gravel for the production of concrete and for road construction (the background process used refers to the period 2013-2021). Benefits and impacts associated to these operations were therefore evaluated. According to EN 16908:2017+A1 the carbonation of cement and natural hydraulic lime can be very relevant after demolition with consistent carbon dioxide uptake. The evaluation of carbon dioxide uptake was carried out according to the procedure described in EN 16757. In particular it was considered that: for the C1-C3 stages no carbonation occurs due to the limited time of exposure to air or to the lack of information regarding the duration of air exposure., for the C4 stage it was considered a carbon dioxide uptake equal to 75 % of the maximum theoretical carbon dioxide uptake for landfilled wastes. No uptake was considered for recycled wastes., for the D stage it was considered a carbon dioxide uptake equal to 100 % of the maximum theoretical carbon dioxide uptake. The following values (evaluated according to stoichiometry) were used as maximum uptake values: Natural hydraulic lime: 440 kg CO2/ton, Cement: 490 kg CO2/ton. It should be highlighted that since Miniera San Romedio produces ready mixed products and has no control and no information regarding their applications it was impossible, due to lack of data, to calculate the contribution of carbonation in the use stage (module B). Regarding the end-of-life of the packaging paper (100 % recyclable), it was not considered since beyond the boundaries of the system."

        "Szenariobeschreibung": "The electrical energy consumed in Miniera San Romedio Srl plants is a fully renewable certified energy. The electrical energy is derived from renewable energy source (hydropower) that have obtained certification with the renewable energy certification. The electrical energy is converted from high voltage to low voltage using an electrical transformer located close to the plants. The certification of the renewability of the energy covers to whole period analysed in this study (2021-2022). For as concerns the energy source to feed the furnace for the NHL production, hard coal, with a total heat evolution of 787 Mcal to cook 1 ton of NHL, was considered. For the internal transportations, gasoline with a calorific power of 45 MJ/kg was considered. For as concerns the end-of-life stage, the demolition, transport, treatment, and disposal of wastes were modelled using processes present in the Ecoinvent database and modified to the specific case. In particular, for the C1 stage (demolition/deconstruction) the use of a diesel operating machine with a productivity of 16.6 min/ton of demolished material and a diesel consumption of 0.9 lt/m3 was considered. A water consumption of 0.018 m3 /m3 was considered. Both references were taken from Ivanica et al., for the C2 stage a distance of 15 km was assumed according to data provided by Italia del Riciclo referred to the year 2021., for the C3 and C4 stages, despite the NHL injection mortar can be fully recycled and due to the lack of specific information regarding the end-of-life of this product, it was assumed that, after a sorting and crushing process, 78.1 wt% of inert wastes is recycled (reaching the end-of-waste state) while the remaining part is landfilled (data provided by Italia del Riciclo referred to the year 2021). For the sorting and crushing process an existing Ecoinvent process was adapted to the specific case., for the stage D it was considered that the secondary materials were used as alternative to gravel for the production of concrete and for road construction (the background process used refers to the period 2013-2021). Benefits and impacts associated to these operations were therefore evaluated. According to EN 16908:2017+A1 the carbonation of cement and natural hydraulic lime can be very relevant after demolition with consistent carbon dioxide uptake. The evaluation of carbon dioxide uptake was carried out according to the procedure described in EN 16757. In particular it was considered that: for the C1-C3 stages no carbonation occurs due to the limited time of exposure to air or to the lack of information regarding the duration of air exposure., for the C4 stage it was considered a carbon dioxide uptake equal to 75 % of the maximum theoretical carbon dioxide uptake for landfilled wastes. No uptake was considered for recycled wastes., for the D stage it was considered a carbon dioxide uptake equal to 100 % of the maximum theoretical carbon dioxide uptake. The following values (evaluated according to stoichiometry) were used as maximum uptake values: Natural hydraulic lime: 440 kg CO2/ton, Cement: 490 kg CO2/ton. It should be highlighted that since Miniera San Romedio produces ready mixed products and has no control and no information regarding their applications it was impossible, due to lack of data, to calculate the contribution of carbonation in the use stage (module B).

In cases, where datasets for chemical dispersion where not available, market for datasets where used, to include transport of the raw materials to the suppliers. Transport distances for all raw materials used (chemicals, packaging) could be recorded. A payload factor of 50% was used for all truck transports (suppliers, disposal transports and internal transports), which corresponds to a full delivery and empty return trip. A data set for a non-specific truck was used. Dr. Schutz GmbH purchases 100% renewable electricity. 2021 the share of renewable energy sources on the total renewable energy in Germany was as followed: Wind power: 53.6%, solar power 20.6%, biomass 18.5%, hydropower 7.3%. Based on this assumption an electricity data set was generated for the LCA calculation. No CO2 certificates were considered. For the third-party filler, no data on energy consumption was available, therefore it was assumed, that the energy consumption for crosslinker production is equally high as for the lacquer. As electricity source the German electricity mix was taken. Concerning the waste water during processing, the water is collected and fed back into the process. According to the manufacturer, almost none processing waste occurs during production. Therefore, a generic value of 1% production waste was assumed, to cover low amounts of waste. Concerning construction waste, 15% was chosen, which is the recommendation of R<THiNK for product from the category ?auxiliary and finishing materials?. Concerning the transport from manufacturer to place of use (A4), an average was calculated based on the distance of production location to the countries supplied. The installation process was calculated based on the information material on preparation of floors(compare https://www.dr-schutz.com/wp-content/uploads/TI_EN_002_Preparation_of_resilient_floorings_200814.pdf, https://www.dr-schutz.com/wp-content/uploads/PI_EN_PU_Sealer_Waxnomor_170523.pdf). Based on the specific product information, two coating processes with 50 ml each were assumed. As the density of lacquer and crosslinker are almost 1g/ml, 100 g/m² for total process was taken for calculation. For installation phase (A5), and module C and D, Germany was chosen as location, as it is the main market area (compare chapter 2.3). According to the preparation guideline (https://www.dr-schutz.com/wp-content/uploads/TI_EN_002_Preparation_of_resilient_floorings_200814.pdf), a two-stage cleaning (first with a cleanser, second only water) is assumed. For the cleanser, a generic dataset from the ecoinvent database is taken (Cleaning consumables, without water, in 13.6% solution state (GLO)| market for), mixed in the ratio 1:5 and applied with an amount of 200 ml/per m². An overflow or unused portion of 15% of the prepared sealer is assumed during the installation process. As the floor covering is disposed as part of the flooring system, the demolition process is not considered as a load for the calculated system. Therefore, C1 is considered to be zero. For the production process waste, the EcoInvent scenario Spent solvent mixture {Europe without Switzerland}| treatment of spent solvent mixture, hazardous waste incineration | Cut-off, U was chosen, which assumes 100% incineration. For the plastic containers and bottles the NMD scenario plastics, via residue (NMD ID 43) was chosen, which assumes that 80% are incinerated, while 20% are landfilled. For the sealer itself, 100% incineration was assumed as waste scenario, which fits the waste treatment of PVC floor covering. The incineration loads were calculated using an EcoInvent dataset for waste paint. Note: The transport distances of the waste are based on the standard waste scenarios of the NMD Determination Method (SBK 2019): incineration 150 km / recycling 50 km / landfill 100 km, vehicle: truck, unspecific. For energy recovery, only benefits for plastics were included, as the lower heating value of the chemicals was not available. According the EN 15804, loads are credited in A3 or C3 to C4 and benefits are credited in module D. For all transports, the environmental profile of a non-specific truck transport was used (conservative assumption): The vehicle operates with diesel, and it provides a fleet average that includes different lorry classes as well as EURO classes. This environmental profile contains data for transport, which is calculated for an average load factor, including empty return trips (EcoInvent 3.6)."

As the floor covering is disposed as part of the flooring system, the demolition process is not considered as a load for the calculated system. Therefore, C1 is considered to be zero. For the production process waste, the EcoInvent scenario Spent solvent mixture {Europe without Switzerland}| treatment of spent solvent mixture, hazardous waste incineration | Cut-off, U was chosen, which assumes 100% incineration. For the plastic containers and bottles the NMD scenario plastics, via residue (NMD ID 43) was chosen, which assumes that 80% are incinerated, while 20% are landfilled. For the sealer itself, 100% incineration was assumed as waste scenario, which fits the waste treatment of PVC floor covering. The incineration loads were calculated using an EcoInvent dataset for waste paint. Note: The transport distances of the waste are based on the standard waste scenarios of the NMD Determination Method (SBK 2019): incineration 150 km / recycling 50 km / landfill 100 km, vehicle: truck, unspecific. For energy recovery, only benefits for plastics were included, as the lower heating value of the chemicals was not available. According the EN 15804, loads are credited in A3 or C3 to C4 and benefits are credited in module D. For all transports, the environmental profile of a non-specific truck transport was used (conservative assumption): The vehicle operates with diesel, and it provides a fleet average that includes different lorry classes as well as EURO classes. This environmental profile contains data for transport, which is calculated for an average load factor, including empty return trips (EcoInvent 3.6)."

The certification of the renewability of the energy covers to whole period analysed in this study (2021-2022). For the internal transportations, gasoline with a calorific power of 45 MJ/kg was considered. For as concerns the end-of-life stage, the demolition, transport, treatment, and disposal of wastes were modelled using processes present in the Ecoinvent database and modified to the specific case. In particular, for the C1 stage (demolition/deconstruction) the use of a diesel operating machine with a productivity of 16.6 min/ton of demolished material and a diesel consumption of 0.9 lt/m3 was considered. A water consumption of 0.018 m3 /m3 was considered. Both references were taken from Ivanica et al., for the C2 stage a distance of 15 km was assumed according to data provided by Italia del Riciclo referred to the year 2021., for the C3 and C4 stages, despite the cement mortar can be fully recycled and due to the lack of specific information regarding the end-of-life of this product, it was assumed that, after a sorting and crushing process, 78.1 wt% of inert wastes is recycled (reaching the end-of-waste state) while the remaining part is landfilled (data provided by Italia del Riciclo referred to the year 2021). For the sorting and crushing process an existing Ecoinvent process was adapted to the specific case., for the stage D it was considered that the secondary materials were used as alternative to gravel for the production of concrete and for road construction (the background process used refers to the period 2013-2021). Benefits and impacts associated to these operations were therefore evaluated. According to EN 16908:2017+A1 the carbonation of cement and hydrated lime can be very relevant after demolition with consistent carbon dioxide uptake. The evaluation of carbon dioxide uptake was carried out according to the procedure described in EN 16757. In particular it was considered that: for the C1-C3 stages no carbonation occurs due to the limited time of exposure to air or to the lack of information regarding the duration of air exposure., for the C4 stage it was considered a carbon dioxide uptake equal to 75 % of the maximum theoretical carbon dioxide uptake for landfilled wastes. No uptake was considered for recycled wastes., for the D stage it was considered a carbon dioxide uptake equal to 100 % of the maximum theoretical carbon dioxide uptake. The following values (evaluated according to stoichiometry) were used as maximum uptake values: Cement: 490 kg CO2/ton, Hydrated lime: 594 kg CO2/ton. It should be highlighted that since Miniera San Romedio produces ready mixed products and has no control and no information regarding their applications it was impossible, due to lack of data, to calculate the contribution of carbonation in the use stage (module B). Regarding the end-of-life of the packaging paper (100 % recyclable), it was not considered since beyond the boundaries of the system."

        "Szenariobeschreibung": "If available, datasets which refer to the EU as the geographic reference where chosen (approx. 50%), otherwise global datasets were used. In cases, where datasets for chemical dispersion where not available, market for datasets where used, to include transport of the raw materials to the suppliers. Transport distances for all raw materials used (chemicals, packaging) could be recorded. A payload factor of 50% was used for all truck transports (suppliers, disposal transports and internal transports), which corresponds to a full delivery and empty return trip. A data set for a non-specific truck was used. Dr. Schutz GmbH purchases 100% renewable electricity. 2021 the share of renewable energy sources on the total renewable energy in Germany was as followed: Wind power: 53.6%, solar power 20.6%, biomass 18.5%, hydropower 7.3%. Based on this assumption an electricity data set was generated for the LCA calculation. No CO2 certificates were considered. For the third-party filler, no data on energy consumption was available, therefore it was assumed, that the energy consumption for crosslinker production is equally high as for the lacquer. As electricity source the German electricity mix was taken. Concerning the waste water during processing, the water is collected and fed back into the process. According to the manufacturer, almost none processing waste occurs during production. Therefore, a generic value of 1% production waste was assumed, to cover low amounts of waste. Concerning construction waste, 15% was chosen, which is the recommendation of R<THiNK for product from the category ?auxiliary and finishing materials?. Concerning the transport from manufacturer to place of use (A4), an average was calculated based on the distance of production location to the countries supplied. The installation process was calculated based on the information material on preparation of floors (compare https://www.dr-schutz.com/wp-content/uploads/TI_EN_002_Preparation_of_resilient_floorings_200814.pdf, https://www.dr-schutz.com/wp-content/uploads/PI_EN_PU_Color_200803.pdf). Based on the specific product information, two coating processes with 90-100 ml was assumed. As the density of lacquer and crosslinker are almost 1g/ml, 200 g/m² for total process was taken for calculation. For installation phase (A5), and module C and D, Germany was chosen as location, as it is the main market area (compare chapter 2.3). According to the preparation guideline (https://www.dr-schutz.com/wp-content/uploads/TI_EN_002_Preparation_of_resilient_floorings_200814.pdf), a two-stage cleaning (first with a cleanser, second only water) is assumed. For the cleanser, a generic dataset from the ecoinvent database is taken (Cleaning consumables, without water, in 13.6% solution state (GLO)| market for), mixed in the ratio 1:5 and applied with an amount of 200 ml/per m². An overflow or unused portion of 15% of the prepared sealer is assumed during the installation process. As the floor covering is disposed as part of the flooring system, the demolition process is not considered as a load for the calculated system. Therefore, C1 is considered to be zero. For the production process waste, the EcoInvent scenario Spent solvent mixture {Europe without Switzerland}| treatment of spent solvent mixture, hazardous waste incineration | Cut-off, U was chosen, which assumes 100% incineration. For the plastic containers and bottles the NMD scenario plastics, via residue (NMD ID 43) was chosen, which assumes that 80% are incinerated, while 20% are landfilled. For the sealer itself, 100% incineration was assumed as waste scenario, which fits the waste treatment of PVC floor covering. The incineration loads were calculated using an EcoInvent dataset for waste paint. Note: The transport distances of the waste are based on the standard waste scenarios of the NMD Determination Method (SBK 2019): incineration 150 km / recycling 50 km / landfill 100 km, vehicle: truck, unspecific.

In cases, where datasets for chemical dispersion where not available, market for datasets where used, to include transport of the raw materials to the suppliers. Transport distances for all raw materials used (chemicals, packaging) could be recorded. A payload factor of 50% was used for all truck transports (suppliers, disposal transports and internal transports), which corresponds to a full delivery and empty return trip. A data set for a non-specific truck was used. Dr. Schutz GmbH purchases 100% renewable electricity. 2021 the share of renewable energy sources on the total renewable energy in Germany was as followed: Wind power: 53.6%, solar power 20.6%, biomass 18.5%, hydropower 7.3%. Based on this assumption an electricity data set was generated for the LCA calculation. No CO2 certificates were considered. For the third-party filler, no data on energy consumption was available, therefore it was assumed, that the energy consumption for crosslinker production is equally high as for the lacquer. As electricity source the German electricity mix was taken. Concerning the waste water during processing, the water is collected and fed back into the process. According to the manufacturer, almost none processing waste occurs during production. Therefore, a generic value of 1% production waste was assumed, to cover low amounts of waste. Concerning construction waste, 15% was chosen, which is the recommendation of R<THiNK for product from the category ?auxiliary and finishing materials?. Concerning the transport from manufacturer to place of use (A4), an average was calculated based on the distance of production location to the countries supplied. The installation process was calculated based on the information material on preparation of floors (compare https://www.dr-schutz.com/wp-content/uploads/TI_EN_002_Preparation_of_resilient_floorings_200814.pdf, https://www.dr-schutz.com/wp-content/uploads/PI_EN_PU_Color_200803.pdf). Based on the specific product information, two coating processes with 90-100 ml was assumed. As the density of lacquer and crosslinker are almost 1g/ml, 200 g/m² for total process was taken for calculation. For installation phase (A5), and module C and D, Germany was chosen as location, as it is the main market area (compare chapter 2.3). According to the preparation guideline (https://www.dr-schutz.com/wp-content/uploads/TI_EN_002_Preparation_of_resilient_floorings_200814.pdf), a two-stage cleaning (first with a cleanser, second only water) is assumed. For the cleanser, a generic dataset from the ecoinvent database is taken (Cleaning consumables, without water, in 13.6% solution state (GLO)| market for), mixed in the ratio 1:5 and applied with an amount of 200 ml/per m². An overflow or unused portion of 15% of the prepared sealer is assumed during the installation process. As the floor covering is disposed as part of the flooring system, the demolition process is not considered as a load for the calculated system. Therefore, C1 is considered to be zero. For the production process waste, the EcoInvent scenario Spent solvent mixture {Europe without Switzerland}| treatment of spent solvent mixture, hazardous waste incineration | Cut-off, U was chosen, which assumes 100% incineration. For the plastic containers and bottles the NMD scenario plastics, via residue (NMD ID 43) was chosen, which assumes that 80% are incinerated, while 20% are landfilled. For the sealer itself, 100% incineration was assumed as waste scenario, which fits the waste treatment of PVC floor covering. The incineration loads were calculated using an EcoInvent dataset for waste paint. Note: The transport distances of the waste are based on the standard waste scenarios of the NMD Determination Method (SBK 2019): incineration 150 km / recycling 50 km / landfill 100 km, vehicle: truck, unspecific.

Based on the specific product information, two coating processes with 90-100 ml was assumed. As the density of lacquer and crosslinker are almost 1g/ml, 200 g/m² for total process was taken for calculation. For installation phase (A5), and module C and D, Germany was chosen as location, as it is the main market area (compare chapter 2.3). According to the preparation guideline (https://www.dr-schutz.com/wp-content/uploads/TI_EN_002_Preparation_of_resilient_floorings_200814.pdf), a two-stage cleaning (first with a cleanser, second only water) is assumed. For the cleanser, a generic dataset from the ecoinvent database is taken (Cleaning consumables, without water, in 13.6% solution state (GLO)| market for), mixed in the ratio 1:5 and applied with an amount of 200 ml/per m². An overflow or unused portion of 15% of the prepared sealer is assumed during the installation process. As the floor covering is disposed as part of the flooring system, the demolition process is not considered as a load for the calculated system. Therefore, C1 is considered to be zero. For the production process waste, the EcoInvent scenario Spent solvent mixture {Europe without Switzerland}| treatment of spent solvent mixture, hazardous waste incineration | Cut-off, U was chosen, which assumes 100% incineration. For the plastic containers and bottles the NMD scenario plastics, via residue (NMD ID 43) was chosen, which assumes that 80% are incinerated, while 20% are landfilled. For the sealer itself, 100% incineration was assumed as waste scenario, which fits the waste treatment of PVC floor covering. The incineration loads were calculated using an EcoInvent dataset for waste paint. Note: The transport distances of the waste are based on the standard waste scenarios of the NMD Determination Method (SBK 2019): incineration 150 km / recycling 50 km / landfill 100 km, vehicle: truck, unspecific. For energy recovery, only benefits for plastics were included, as the lower heating value of the chemicals was not available. According the EN 15804, loads are credited in A3 or C3 to C4 and benefits are credited in module D. For all transports, the environmental profile of a non-specific truck transport was used (conservative assumption): The vehicle operates with diesel, and it provides a fleet average that includes different lorry classes as well as EURO classes. This environmental profile contains data for transport, which is calculated for an average load factor, including empty return trips (EcoInvent 3.6)."

Transport distances for all raw materials used (chemicals, packaging) could be recorded. A payload factor of 50% was used for all truck transports (suppliers, disposal transports and internal transports), which corresponds to a full delivery and empty return trip. A data set for a non-specific truck was used. Dr. Schutz GmbH purchases 100% renewable electricity. 2021 the share of renewable energy sources on the total renewable energy in Germany was as followed: Wind power: 53.6%, solar power 20.6%, biomass 18.5%, hydropower 7.3%. Based on this assumption an electricity data set was generated for the LCA calculation. No CO2 certificates were considered. For the third-party filler, no data on energy consumption was available, therefore it was assumed, that the energy consumption for crosslinker production is equally high as for the lacquer. As electricity source the German electricity mix was taken. According to the manufacturer, almost none processing waste occurs during production. Therefore, a generic value of 1% production waste was assumed, to cover low amounts of waste. Concerning construction waste, 15% was chosen, which is the recommendation of R<THiNK for product from the category ?auxiliary and finishing materials?. Concerning the transport from manufacturer to place of use (A4), an average was calculated based on the distance of production location to the countries supplied. The installation process was calculated based on the information material on preparation of floors(compare https://www.dr-schutz.com/wp-content/uploads/TI_EN_002_Preparation_of_resilient_floorings_200814.pdf, https://www.dr-schutz.com/wp-content/uploads/PI_EN_PU_Sealer_UV_190712.pdf). Based on the specific product information, one coating process with 100 ml was assumed. As the density of lacquer and crosslinker are almost 1g/ml, 100 g/m² for total process was taken for calculation. For installation phase (A5), and module C and D, Germany was chosen as location, as it is the main market area (compare chapter 2.3). According to the preparation guideline (https://www.dr-schutz.com/wp-content/uploads/TI_EN_002_Preparation_of_resilient_floorings_200814.pdf), a two-stage cleaning (first with a cleanser, second only water) is assumed. For the cleanser, a generic dataset from the ecoinvent database is taken (Cleaning consumables, without water, in 13.6% solution state (GLO)| market for), mixed in the ratio 1:5 and applied with an amount of 200 ml/per m². An overflow or unused portion of 15% of the prepared sealer is assumed during the installation process. As the floor covering is disposed as part of the flooring system, the demolition process is not considered as a load for the calculated system. Therefore, C1 is considered to be zero. For the production process waste, the EcoInvent scenario Spent solvent mixture {Europe without Switzerland}| treatment of spent solvent mixture, hazardous waste incineration | Cut-off, U was chosen, which assumes 100% incineration. For the plastic containers and bottles the NMD scenario plastics, via residue (NMD ID 43) was chosen, which assumes that 80% are incinerated, while 20% are landfilled. For the sealer itself, 100% incineration was assumed as waste scenario, which fits the waste treatment of PVC floor covering. The incineration loads were calculated using an EcoInvent dataset for waste paint. Note: The transport distances of the waste are based on the standard waste scenarios of the NMD Determination Method (SBK 2019): incineration 150 km/ recycling 50 km / landfill 100 km, vehicle: truck, unspecific. For energy recovery, only benefits for plastics were included, as the lower heating value of the chemicals was not available. According the EN 15804, loads are credited in A3 or C3 to C4 and benefits are credited in module D. For all transports, the environmental profile of a non-specific truck transport was used (conservative assumption): The vehicle operates with diesel, and it provides a fleet average that includes different lorry classes as well as EURO classes. This environmental profile contains data for transport, which is calculated for an average load factor, including empty return trips (EcoInvent 3.6)."

The incineration loads were calculated using an EcoInvent dataset for waste paint. Note: The transport distances of the waste are based on the standard waste scenarios of the NMD Determination Method (SBK 2019): incineration 150 km/ recycling 50 km / landfill 100 km, vehicle: truck, unspecific. For energy recovery, only benefits for plastics were included, as the lower heating value of the chemicals was not available. According the EN 15804, loads are credited in A3 or C3 to C4 and benefits are credited in module D. For all transports, the environmental profile of a non-specific truck transport was used (conservative assumption): The vehicle operates with diesel, and it provides a fleet average that includes different lorry classes as well as EURO classes. This environmental profile contains data for transport, which is calculated for an average load factor, including empty return trips (EcoInvent 3.6)."

In cases, where datasets for chemical dispersion where not available, market for datasets where used, to include transport of the raw materials to the suppliers. Transport distances for all raw materials used (chemicals, packaging) could be recorded. A payload factor of 50% was used for all truck transports (suppliers, disposal transports and internal transports), which corresponds to a full delivery and empty return trip. A data set for a non-specific truck was used. Dr. Schutz GmbH purchases 100% renewable electricity. 2021 the share of renewable energy sources on the total renewable energy in Germany was as followed: Wind power: 53.6%, solar power 20.6%, biomass 18.5%, hydropower 7.3%. Based on this assumption an electricity data set was generated for the LCA calculation. No CO2 certificates were considered. For the third-party filler, no data on energy consumption was available, therefore it was assumed, that the energy consumption for crosslinker production is equally high as for the lacquer. As electricity source the German electricity mix was taken. According to the manufacturer, almost none processing waste occurs during production. Therefore, a generic value of 1% production waste was assumed, to cover low amounts of waste. Concerning construction waste, 15% was chosen, which is the recommendation of R<THiNK for product from the category ?auxiliary and finishing materials?. Concerning the transport from manufacturer to place of use (A4), an average was calculated based on the distance of production location to the countries supplied. The installation process was calculated based on the information material on preparation of floors(compare https://www.dr-schutz.com/wp-content/uploads/TI_EN_002_Preparation_of_resilient_floorings_200814.pdf, https://www.dr-schutz.com/wp-content/uploads/PI_EN_PU_Sealer_UV_190712.pdf). Based on the specific product information, one coating process with 100 ml was assumed. As the density of lacquer and crosslinker are almost 1g/ml, 100 g/m² for total process was taken for calculation. For installation phase (A5), and module C and D, Germany was chosen as location, as it is the main market area (compare chapter 2.3). According to the preparation guideline (https://www.dr-schutz.com/wp-content/uploads/TI_EN_002_Preparation_of_resilient_floorings_200814.pdf), a two-stage cleaning (first with a cleanser, second only water) is assumed. For the cleanser, a generic dataset from the ecoinvent database is taken (Cleaning consumables, without water, in 13.6% solution state (GLO)| market for), mixed in the ratio 1:5 and applied with an amount of 200 ml/per m². An overflow or unused portion of 15% of the prepared sealer is assumed during the installation process. As the floor covering is disposed as part of the flooring system, the demolition process is not considered as a load for the calculated system. Therefore, C1 is considered to be zero. For the production process waste, the EcoInvent scenario Spent solvent mixture {Europe without Switzerland}| treatment of spent solvent mixture, hazardous waste incineration | Cut-off, U was chosen, which assumes 100% incineration.
