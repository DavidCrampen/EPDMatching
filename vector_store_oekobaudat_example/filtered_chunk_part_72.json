        "Szenariobeschreibung": "Almost all datasets chosen for the LCA refer to the EU as the geographic reference. Transport distances for all raw materials (raw materials, operating materials, packaging) could be recorded. A payload factor of 50% was used for all truck transports (suppliers, disposal transports, and internal transports), which corresponds to a full delivery and empty return trip. A data set for a non-specific truck was used. The energy and material consumptions are average values and refer to the year 2019. The Erndtebrück site also processes other steel products. Measured in terms of output, construction pipes account for 27 percent of mass production. The total amount of waste products generated, including slag, dust, and scrap, was reported at 18,4 kg per ton of product. The proportions of these three waste products are used as a reference value for calculating the raw material production waste amount. As a result, in the following report, overall, 1.84% of the product is considered waste during production. Structural pipes are marketed worldwide. No average transport distances could be determined, as the logistics are sometimes organized by the customer and sometimes by EEW. After consultation with EEW's logistics department, frequent transport was chosen as a representative transport route (A4): Erndtebrück ? Rotterdam (300 km) by railway. For installation (A5), a self-propelled jack-up barge, 600 ton, 2x engines 310 liters/hr (steaming) for one day (24 hr) with 1x generator 88 liters/hr (standby) for 12 hr was assumed to work based on literature. No CO2 certificates were considered. The distance to the construction site (A4) was calculated according to the NMD (Nationale Milieu Database (Dutch National Environmental Database)) method. Accordingly, the distance between the production site in Erndtebrück and Rotterdam was considered (300 km) by railway. It is assumed that no activities for maintenance, repair, transport and replacement, refurbishment, or other material and energy flows take place during the RSL. Modules B1 to B7 are therefore assumed to be zero. Due to a high life expectancy and the fact that EEW is not responsible for this, there is no company data available on the material recovery of installed structural pipes. However, since there is a high potential for recycling and reusing structural steel pipe, this solution remains an attractive possibility. So, it is assumed that removal will be performed in the same manner as installation, a self-propelled jack-up barge, 600 ton, 2x engines 310 liters/hr (steaming) for one day (24 hr) with 1x generator 88 liters/hr (standby) for 12 hr, with the addition of an oxy-fuel cutting operation are stated for module C1 (demolition). For the calculation of end-of-life, the standard waste scenario for steel, permanent (100yr) sheet piles placed in soil/marine water was followed based on the \"national milieu databank\" (NMD ID 90). This defines the waste scenario as 63.2% recycling and 36.8% to be left. Note: The transport distances of the waste are based on the standard waste scenarios of the NMD Determination Method (SBK 2019): incineration 150 km/ recycling 50 km/landfill 100 km, vehicle: truck, unspecific. For energy recovery, it is assumed that only fossil raw materials are substituted, considering the calorific values of the raw materials of the declared product and energy and thermal efficiencies of 18% and 32%. According to EN 15804, loads are credited in A3 or C3 to C4, and benefits are credited in module D. For all road transports, the environmental profile of a non-specific truck transport was used (conservative assumption): The vehicle operates with diesel and provides a fleet average that includes different lorry classes and EURO classes. This environmental profile contains data for transport, which is calculated for an average load factor, including empty return trips (Ecoinvent 3.6)."

For installation (A5), a self-propelled jack-up barge, 600 ton, 2x engines 310 liters/hr (steaming) for one day (24 hr) with 1x generator 88 liters/hr (standby) for 12 hr was assumed to work based on literature. No CO2 certificates were considered. The distance to the construction site (A4) was calculated according to the NMD (Nationale Milieu Database (Dutch National Environmental Database)) method. Accordingly, the distance between the production site in Erndtebrück and Rotterdam was considered (300 km) by railway. It is assumed that no activities for maintenance, repair, transport and replacement, refurbishment, or other material and energy flows take place during the RSL. Modules B1 to B7 are therefore assumed to be zero. Due to a high life expectancy and the fact that EEW is not responsible for this, there is no company data available on the material recovery of installed structural pipes. However, since there is a high potential for recycling and reusing structural steel pipe, this solution remains an attractive possibility. So, it is assumed that removal will be performed in the same manner as installation, a self-propelled jack-up barge, 600 ton, 2x engines 310 liters/hr (steaming) for one day (24 hr) with 1x generator 88 liters/hr (standby) for 12 hr, with the addition of an oxy-fuel cutting operation are stated for module C1 (demolition). For the calculation of end-of-life, the standard waste scenario for steel, permanent (100yr) sheet piles placed in soil/marine water was followed based on the \"national milieu databank\" (NMD ID 90). This defines the waste scenario as 63.2% recycling and 36.8% to be left. Note: The transport distances of the waste are based on the standard waste scenarios of the NMD Determination Method (SBK 2019): incineration 150 km/ recycling 50 km/landfill 100 km, vehicle: truck, unspecific. For energy recovery, it is assumed that only fossil raw materials are substituted, considering the calorific values of the raw materials of the declared product and energy and thermal efficiencies of 18% and 32%. According to EN 15804, loads are credited in A3 or C3 to C4, and benefits are credited in module D. For all road transports, the environmental profile of a non-specific truck transport was used (conservative assumption): The vehicle operates with diesel and provides a fleet average that includes different lorry classes and EURO classes. This environmental profile contains data for transport, which is calculated for an average load factor, including empty return trips (Ecoinvent 3.6)."

Purchased parts for which no generic data was available were accounted for on the basis of the material composition, which leads to a neglect of production costs and transportation. The highest proportion of environmental impacts is caused by the use phase, which is, however, based on assumptions about the daily usage time. This assumption is therefore of great importance. For this reason, an average period of use was selected. However, even with a minimum daily usage time, the contribution of the usage phase would dominate. Transport to construction site: The customers of Steinel are B2B as well as B2C customers. This means that either partners with their own storage space or customers can be supplied directly. This calculation is very complex. In order to calculate the environmental impact, the example of a building site in Dresden was selected. This meant that the distance to a construction site in Dresden was assumed in the calculation. The distance between our warehouse in Herzebrock-Clarholz and Dresden is 500 km. This calculation and the scenario make it possible to calculate the environmental impact for the distance to your own construction site. Use-Stage: During the usage phase, the luminaire consumes energy in the form of electricity. The electricity consumption was balanced for the use phase. Origin of electricity: A European electricity mix was assumed for the usage scenario (market for electricity low voltage - RER)."

This calculation and the scenario make it possible to calculate the environmental impact for the distance to your own construction site. Use-Stage: Unlike described in PCR Part B, the full load hours were determined with the help of an analysis by an external project. Taking the formula into account would make luminaires with sensors look worse in terms of environmental performance. Therefore, in one project, intelligent lighting from the R series (similar to the S series) was installed in the stairwell of a residential complex in order to determine the actual full-load hours and consumption of these luminaires.

For this reason, an average period of use was selected. However, even with a minimum daily usage time, the contribution of the usage phase would dominate. Transport to construction site: The customers of Steinel are B2B as well as B2C customers. This means that either partners with their own storage space or customers can be supplied directly. This calculation is very complex. In order to calculate the environmental impact, the example of a building site in Dresden was selected. This meant that the distance to a construction site in Dresden was assumed in the calculation. The distance between our warehouse in Herzebrock-Clarholz and Dresden is 500 km. This calculation and the scenario make it possible to calculate the environmental impact for the distance to your own construction site. Use-Stage: Unlike described in PCR Part B, the full load hours were determined with the help of an analysis by an external project. Taking the formula into account would make luminaires with sensors look worse in terms of environmental performance. Therefore, in one project, intelligent lighting from the R series (similar to the S series) was installed in the stairwell of a residential complex in order to determine the actual full-load hours and consumption of these luminaires. To determine the full load hours, load profile measurements were carried out in summer July 29, 2021 - August 29, 2021 and in winter October 15, 2021 - November 04, 2021. The measurements were used to determine the full load hours of 525h/a.  The electricity consumption was calculated for the use phase. Origin of the electricity: A European electricity mix was assumed for the usage scenario (low-voltage electricity market - RER)."

To determine the full load hours, load profile measurements were carried out in summer July 29, 2021 - August 29, 2021 and in winter October 15, 2021 - November 04, 2021. The measurements were used to determine the full load hours of 525h/a.  The electricity consumption was calculated for the use phase.

The highest proportion of environmental impacts is caused by the use phase, which is, however, based on assumptions about the daily usage time. This assumption is therefore of great importance. For this reason, an average period of use was selected. However, even with a minimum daily usage time, the contribution of the usage phase would dominate. Transport to construction: The customers of Steinel are B2B as well as B2C customers. This means that either partners with their own storage space or customers can be supplied directly. This calculation is very complex. In order to calculate the environmental impact, the example of a building site in Dresden was selected. This meant that the distance to a construction site in Dresden was assumed in the calculation. The distance between our warehouse in Herzebrock-Clarholz and Dresden is 500 km. This calculation and the scenario make it possible to calculate the environmental impact for the distance to your own construction site. Use stage: Unlike described in PCR Part B, the full load hours were determined with the help of an analysis by an external project. Taking the formula into account would make luminaires with sensors look worse in terms of environmental performance. Therefore, in one project,the use phase and full load hours were determined with the help of an analysis by an external project. In this project, the intelligent lighting of the 5100 series was installed in a parking garage. The measurements were used to determine the full load hours of 1009 h/a with sensor. The electricity consumption was balanced for the use phase. Origin of electricity: A European electricity mix was assumed for the usage scenario (market for electricity low voltage - RER)."
