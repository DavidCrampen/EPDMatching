According to the PCR, the operational energy use should be calculated based on the type of product (luminaire, lamp, or lamp component). This product is a luminaire.

The exact calculation for this product is given in the corresponding background report. For some parameters an assumption had to be made, because no information on it is available.

The energy consumption of a luminaire can be calculated with the following formula: Energy consumption [kWh] = {Pa * FCP * FO * ( FD * tD + FN * tN) + Pp * ty} * 1/1000 * a (with Pa [W] = active power, FCP = product constant illuminance factor, FO = occupancy dependency factor, FD = daylight dependency factor, tD [h] = daylight operating hours per year, FN = non-daylight dimming factor, tN [h] = non-daylight operating hours per year, Pp [W] = passive power, ty [h] = 8760, a = reference service lifetime of installation in years). The exact calculation for this product is given in the corresponding background report. For some parameters an assumption had to be made, because no information on it is available. Therefore, the numbers for B6 are conservative numbers. The emissions calculated for module B6 are for the full reference service lifetime of 66,000 hours or approximately 17 years."

According to the PCR, the operational energy use should be calculated based on the type of product (luminaire, lamp, or lamp component). This product is a luminaire. The energy consumption of a luminaire can be calculated with the following formula: Energy consumption [kWh] = {Pa * FCP * FO * ( FD * tD + FN * tN) + Pp * ty} * 1/1000 * a (with Pa [W] = active power, FCP = product constant illuminance factor, FO = occupancy dependency factor, FD = daylight dependency factor, tD [h] = daylight operating hours per year, FN = non-daylight dimming factor, tN [h] = non-daylight operating hours per year, Pp [W] = passive power, ty [h] = 8760, a = reference service lifetime of installation in years). The exact calculation for this product is given in the corresponding background report. For some parameters an assumption had to be made, because no information on it is available. Therefore, the numbers for B6 are conservative numbers. The emissions calculated for module B6 are for the full reference service lifetime of 66,000 hours or approximately 17 years."

Module A3: Use of water is declared only for technological process (pickling), no waste scenario is assumed as no wastewater occurs. For the pickling liquid there?s been a waste scenario assumed. The generated production waste concerning the ancillary material is stated per declared unit. For raw material only certain inputs cause production waste. These inputs are declared in kg. Module C1-C4: The floor drains are assumed to be disposed of in Northern Europe. The floor drains are assumed to be dismantled using hand tools (C1) and transported 50 km to a local recycling (C2). The product is disposed according to the selected waste scenario: recovery of materials, recycling 94%, reuse 5 % (C3). The fluff sorted from the shredded metal is landfill by 1% (C4). Module D: The recycled metals are credited an avoided production of primary steel."
